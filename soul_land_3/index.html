                <hr>
                <p>Tang Wulin is an honest and kindhearted individual, which is apparent when he saved Na'Er from a group of teenagers, who were trying to kidnap her and sell her off. He is incredibly hardworking, not letting the words of others affect him negatively. Also having been raised in an impoverished family, he is significantly more sensible and mature than others of his age.</p>
