                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Tang San possesses a very calm and serene personality. He is kind, thoughtful of others, and selfless. He always calculates his options before taking action. As a person of two lives, since childhood, he possessed the maturity of an adult. His thirst for knowledge is astounding as in his previous life, and that thirst for knowledge was the reason he committed suicide. He deeply loves his parents and has a deep regard for his friends, especially Xiao Wu. He would selflessly put himself in front of danger to help his friends. He harbors a dark personality in which he eliminates, dissipates, or renders those who oppose him dead or imbecile if they're considered as enemies who can no longer be reconciled with. Tang San appears to be an intellectual and cool-headed person in combat. He keeps to his promises, like protecting Xiao Wu "forever".</p>
