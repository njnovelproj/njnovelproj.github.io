                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>As a child, Xuanyu was described as being "too well mannered". He always did as told and was rather blunt and naive, openly stating how he feels to others. He was also blissfully unaware of all the strange things happening around him. Overall, unlike other Soul Land protagonists, who were forced to grow up quickly, Xuanyu was a genuine child.

                    However, after meeting Nana and training under her for a while, he matured at a rapid pace. He gained a calm sense towards battle and has shown genuine care for others. As he got older, he began displaying the qualities of a leader as well as being extremely sly and cunning. He also possesses business acumen and became the richest Shrek Student in his year.
                    
                    Later on he also showed both decisive and merciless streaks against his enemies.</p>
